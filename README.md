# Online Harms API (Oh! API) üõ°Ô∏è

This FastAPI application provides an endpoint to detect online harms in social media messages using the `unsloth`
library with the `LLaMA-3.1` model.

The API takes a message as input and returns whether it qualifies as hate speech along with explanations for the
classification, as well as it qualifies as fake news or hyperpartisan content.

- **Frontend**: [Oh! Frontend](https://github.com/palomapiot/oh-front). The frontend provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chatbot.

- **Backend**: [Oh! Backend](https://github.com/nulldiego/oh-back). The backend handles core chatbot functionalities, including data processing, data storage, chats logic and API management.

## üé• Demo

A demo showcasing the chatbot‚Äôs capabilities is available in the `demo` folder of this repository.

## Features üåü

- Uses the `unsloth` library for natural language processing.
- Detects hate speech based on a defined set of criteria.
- Detects fake news based on a defined set of criteria.
- Detects hyperpartisan news based on a defined set of criteria.
- Provides detailed explanations for each message analyzed.
- Optimized for inference with 4-bit quantized models on GPU.

## Prerequisites üìã

- Docker
- An active Hugging Face account for model access

## Setup Instructions ‚öôÔ∏è

### Building the Docker Image üê≥

1. Clone the repository or download the application files.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:palomapiot/oh-api.git
cd oh-api
```

2. Build the Docker image.

```bash
docker build -t oh-api .
```

### Running the Docker Container üöÄ

You can run the FastAPI application in a Docker container as follows:

```bash
docker run -d --gpus all -p 8000:8000 -e HF_TOKEN="your_hugging_face_token" oh-api
```

Replace `your_hugging_face_token` with your Hugging Face API token.

### Accessing the API üåê

Once the application is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## API Endpoints üì°

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /`: Returns a welcome message.
- `POST /analyze`: Analyzes a social media message for online harms.

#### Request body 

```json
{
    "id": "unique_identifier",
    "prompt": "Your message to analyze"
}

```

#### Response

```json
{
    "id": "unique_identifier",
    "text": "response"
}
```

### Error Responses

- `400 Bad Request`: If the `prompt`is not provided.

```json
{
    "detail": "Prompt is required"
}
```

- `500 Internal Server Error`: If an error occurs during the analysis.

```json
{
    "detail": "Error message"
}
```

## Computational Cost ‚ö°

In our demo, we used the quantized 4-bit model `Llama-3-8B-Instruct` from `unsloth` (in both its base version and distilled). The model processes tokens at 0.4143 tokens per second, requiring 8.1 GB of GPU memory. In production, the model runs well on an NVIDIA L4. Environmental impact: the L4 emits 0.04 kg CO2eq per hour, costing $21.20, for 30h of usage.
